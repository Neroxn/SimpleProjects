Simple Projects by using tensorflow,opencv and other frameworks
# 1) Digit Recognizer:
I created simple GUI that can recognize numbers that is written on it. I have trained my model in MNIST dataset using CONV Network. I got %99 accuracy in the validation/test set. 
# 2) Gender Classifier:
Among 2 genders, female and male, this model classifies it with the accuracy of %95. I have trained my model with 1.3 GB data of female and male labeled data. Since this dataset is more comple than MNIST, my model is more complex.
